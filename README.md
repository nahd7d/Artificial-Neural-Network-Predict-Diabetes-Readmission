# Artificial-Neural-Network-Predict-Diabetes-Readmission
Artificial neural network predicts whether a patient with diabetes would be readmitted within 30 days of discharge from the hospital.
Hospitals strive to minimize this because the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) may penalize them for having a readmission rate that is too high.The dataset we are using is focused on diabetes, and whether proper management of blood sugar levels while in the hospital have an impact on readmission.
